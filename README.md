Projects completed as part of BS in Electrical Engineering at Texas State University

The projects listed here have been completed as part of course work towards a BS in Electrical Engineering with a focus in Networks and Communications Systems. Included is work from the first semester of senior design which is a two semester course. There is a commit history comment for each file upload which elaborates on the uploaded files. The file names have been changed to reflect the contents thus making it easier for the user to find anything of interest. While the senior design project file is 75 pages, the short video sums the project up nicely and contains the important aspects of the project in a 3 minute package.
